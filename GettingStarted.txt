Step by step

Software dependencies:
  Make sure 7za is installed [should program check it is / throw a more explicit error if it is not?]
  sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
  
> python3 setup.py install

Follow installation guide from:
  https://github.com/glimmerphoenix/WikiDAT/wiki/Installation-guide

NOTE: on the configuration file config.ini, using date=latest will not work for downloading the latest wiki dump. A particular date MUST be specified. [This is because the /latest/ page is formatted differently, I guess it shouldn't be too difficult to fix]

NOTE: LOAD DATA LOCAL must be enabled. You should set the option local-infile=1 into your MySQL entry of my.cnf file (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10762239/mysql-enable-load-data-local-infile). [This might be a security concern (Section 6.1.6, “Security Issues with LOAD DATA LOCAL”.) Should we look for an alternative ]

Run :

As described on the Quick start guide (https://github.com/glimmerphoenix/WikiDAT/wiki/Quick-start-guide) run the following command to start file download and data extraction:
> cd wikidat
> python3 main.py -c MyConfigFile.ini

[The following steps are not on the quick start guide. Maybe they should?]

Import meta-history pages:

python pages_meta_history.py DB_NAME DB_USER DB_PASSWORD enwiki somewiki_dumps/date/somewiki-date-pages-meta-history.xml.7z pages_meta_history.log

Import logging-info pages:

python pages_logging.py DB_NAME DB_USER DB_PASSWORD somewiki_dumps/date/somewiki-date-pages-logging.xml.gz log_file.log

Import user groups

mysql DB_NAME -u USER -p < somewiki-date-user_groups.sql

[ Should main.py also download *-pages-logging.xml.gz, *-user_groups.sql.gz and *-pages-meta-history.xml.7z and run corresponding *.py files for importing ]

NOTE: Maybe, I would check that parameters in Section 4.2 of "Companion*.pdf" match with those on the scripts.
